<h2>What are we trying to improve?</h2>

<p>The first stable release of Keycloak was way back in 2014. As always when building software there are things that could
have been done better.</p>

<p>With Keycloak.X we are aiming to introduce some bigger changes to make Keycloak leaner, easier and more future-proof.</p>

<p>A few goals with Keycloak.X are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make it easier to configure</li>
<li>Make it easier to scale, including multi-site support</li>
<li>Make it easier to extend</li>
<li>Reduce startup time and memory footprint</li>
<li>Support zero-downtime upgrades</li>
<li>Support continuous delivery</li>
</ul>

<p>This work will be broken into several parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>A new and improved storage layer</li>
<li>A new distribution powered by <a href="https://quarkus.io">Quarkus</a></li>
<li>A new approach to custom providers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Distribution</h2>

<p>Building a new distribution powered by Quarkus will allow us to significantly reduce startup time and memory footprint.</p>

<p>We will be able to create a leaner distribution in terms of size and dependencies as well. Reducing dependencies will
further reduce the number of CVEs in third-party libraries.</p>

<p>We are also planning to introduce a proper Keycloak configuration file, where we will document directly how to configure
everything related to Keycloak. In the current WildFly based distribution the configuration file is very complex as
it contains everything to configure the underlying application server, and more often than not it is required to refer
to WildFly documentation to figure out how to configure things properly.</p>

<h2>Storage</h2>

<p>The current storage layer is complex, especially when deployed to multiple-sites. It has a number of scalability issues
like the number of realms and clients. Sessions are only kept in-memory, which can be good for performance, but not
so great for scaling when you consider a large portion of sessions are idle and unused most of the time.</p>

<p>Exactly what the new storage layer will look like is still to be decided, but we know for sure that we want to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Reduce complexity with regards to configuring, SPIs and schema</li>
<li>Support zero downtime upgrades</li>
<li>Make sure we can scale to large number of realms and clients</li>
<li>Make sure we can scale to millions of sessions, including support for persisting and passivation</li>
</ul>

<h2>Providers</h2>

<p>Providers today have some issues that we would like to address. Including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecation and versioned approach to SPIs - breaking changes to APIs are horrible in a continuous delivery world</li>
<li>Polyglot - not everyone is a JavaEE developer, let's embrace that and allow more options when it comes to extending Keycloak</li>
<li>Sand-boxing - allow safe customizations in a SaaS world</li>
</ul>

<h2>Continuous Delivery</h2>

<p>We are aiming to make it easier to use Keycloak in a continuous delivery world. This should consider Keycloak upgrades,
custom providers as well as configuration.</p>

<p>Keycloak upgrades should be seamless and there should not be any breaking changes, rather deprecation periods.</p>

<p>It should be possible to more easily manage and reproduce the config of Keycloak, including realm config, in different
environments. A developer should be able to try some config changes in a dev environment, push to a test environment,
before finally making the changes live in a production environment.</p>

<h2>Contributing</h2>

<p>We would love help from the community on Keycloak.X. You can contribute with code, with discussions or simply just trying
it out and giving us feedback.</p>

<h2>Migration to Keycloak.X</h2>

<p>There will be a migration required to Keycloak.X. In fact there will be multiple migrations required as everything
mentioned earlier will not be ready in one go.</p>

<p>It is an aim to make this migration as simple and painless as possible though.</p>

<h2>Timing</h2>

<p>We are staring with the Quarkus powered distribution. The aim is to have a fully functional stable distribution by the
end of 2019, but we already have <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak/tree/master/quarkus">a prototype</a> you can try out
and contribute to.</p>

<p>In 2020 we are aiming to work on both the storage layer and providers. Hopefully, by the end of 2020 we will have most
if not everything sorted out.</p>

<p>We will continue to support the current Keycloak version in parallel with Keycloak.X and will give everyone plenty of
time to do the migration before we eventually will pull the plug on the old.</p>                </div>



                <h1><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/09/2019-roadmap.html">What's Coming To Keycloak</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Tuesday, September 03 2019, posted by Stian Thorgersen</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<h3>New Account Console and Account REST API</h3>

<p>The current account console is getting dated. It is also having issues around usability and being hard
to extend. For this reason we had the UXD team at Red Hat develop
<a href="https://marvelapp.com/c90dfi0/screen/59941600">wireframes</a> for a new account console. The new console
is being implemented with React.js providing a better user experience as well as making it easier to extend
and customise.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-6197">JIRA - Account Console</a></li>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-7428">JIRA - Account REST API</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>WebAuthn</h3>

<p>We are working towards adding WebAuthn support both for two factor authentication and passwordless experience.
This task is not as simple as adding an authenticator for WebAuth, but will also require
work on improving authentication flows and the account console.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/multi-factor-admin-and-step-up.md">Design proposal - Authentication flow improvements</a></li>

<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-9365">JIRA - Passwordless</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Operator</h3>

<p>Operators are becoming an important way to manage software running on Kubernetes and we are working on an operator for
Keycloak. The aim is to have an operator published on <a href="https://operatorhub.io/">OperatorHub.io</a> soon which
provides basic install and seamless upgrade capabilities. This will be based on the awesome work done by the
Red Hat Integreatly team.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-7300">JIRA</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/integr8ly/keycloak-operator">Integreatly Keycloak Operator</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Vault</h3>

<p>At the moment to keep credentials such as LDAP bind credentials more secure it is required to encrypt the whole
database. This can be complex and can also have a performance overhead.</p>

<p>We are working towards enabling loading credentials, such as LDAP bind credential and SMTP password, from an external vault.
We're providing a built-in integration with Kubernetes secrets as well as an SPI allowing integrating with any vault provider.</p>

<p>In the future we will also provide the option to encrypt other more dynamic credentials at rest in the database.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-3205">JIRA - Vault</li>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-10774">JIRA - Encryption at rest</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>User Profile</h3>

<p>Currently there's no single place to define user profiles for a realm. To resolve this we are planning to introduce the Profile SPI,
which will make it possible to define a user profile for a realm. It will be possible to define mandatory as well as
optional attributes and also add validation to the attributes.</p>

<p>The built-in Profile SPI provider will make it possible to declaratively define the user profile for a realm and we
also aim to have an editor in the admin console.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-2966">JIRA</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Observerability</h3>

<p>Keycloak already comes with basic support for metrics and health endpoints provided by the underlying WildFly container.
We plan to document how to enable this as well as extend with Keycloak specific metrics and health checks. If you would
like to try this out today check the WildFly documentation.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-8288">JIRA</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Continuous Delivery</h3>

<p>Over the last few months the team has invested a significant amount of time into automated testing and builds. This
will pay of in the long run as we will need to spend less time on releases and will also make sure Keycloak is always
release ready. In fact we're taking this as far as not allowing maintainers to manually merge PRs anymore, but rather
have created a bot called the Merge Monster that will merge PRs automatically after they have been both manually reviewed
and all tests have passed.</p>


<h3>Keycloak.X</h3>

<p>It's 5 years since the first Keycloak release so high time for some rearchitecting. More details coming soon!</p>

                <h1><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/08/keycloak-jdbc-ping.html">Keycloak and JDBC Ping</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Monday, August 12 2019, posted by Sebastian Łaskaiwec</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p>
A few months back, we had a great article about clustering using <a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#JDBC_PING">JDBC_PING</a> protocol. Since then, we introduced some improvements for the <a href="https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak?tab=tags">Keycloak container image</a> that can simplify the setup. So, before diving into this blog post, I highly encourage you to visit the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/05/keycloak-cluster-setup.html">Keycloak Cluster Setup</a> article.
</p>


<h2>What has changed in our Container Image?</h2>
<p>
Probably the most important change is configuring the JGroups discovery protocol by using variables (see the <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/pull/151">Pull Request</a>). Once the change got in, we could configure the JGroups discovery by setting two properties:
<ul>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL</li>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Let's apply the changes, shall we...</h2>
<p>
The JDBC_PING-based setup works fine in all scenarios, where we connect all Keyclaok instances to the same database. Since JDBC_PING can be configured to obtain a database connection using JNDI binding, it can easily connect to the Keycloak database. All we need to do is to add two parameters to our docker image:
<ul>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING</li>
<li>JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES=datasource_jndi_name=java:jboss/datasources/KeycloakDS</li>
</ul>
</p>

You may find an end-to-end scenario <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/pull/204">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Additional configuration</h2>
<p>
In some scenarios, you may need additional configuration. All additional settings might be added to the JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES. Here are some hints and common problems, that you may find:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Problem description</td>
<td>Possible solution</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The initialization SQL needs to be adjusted</td>
<td>In this case, you might want to look at <tt>initialize_sql</tt> JDBC_PING property</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When Keycloak crashes, the database is not cleared</td>
<td>Turn <tt>remove_old_coords_on_view_change</tt> property on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When Keycloak crashes, the database is not cleared</td>
<td>Also, when a cluster is not too large, you may turn the <tt>remove_all_data_on_view_change</tt> property on</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sometimes, Keycloak doesn't write its data into the database</td>
<td>You may lower the <tt>info_writer_sleep_time</tt> and <tt>info_writer_max_writes_after_view</tt> property values</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

                <h1><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/05/keycloak-cluster-setup.html">Keycloak Cluster Setup</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Friday, May 10 2019, posted by 张立强 liqiang@fit2cloud.com</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">This post shares some solutions to setup Keycloak cluster in various scenarios (e.g. cross-DC, docker cross-host, Kubernetes).</p>

<p>If you'd like to setup Keycloak cluster, this blog may give you some reference.</p>

<p>Two cli script files are added to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/">Keycloak image</a> as per the <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/blob/master/server/README.md#adding-custom-discovery-protocols">guide</a>.</p>

<p>The Dockerfile is below and these two files are the most important matter for this blog, you can find them from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration/master/src/TCPPING.cli">TCPPING.cli</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration/master/src/JDBC_PING.cli">JDBC_PING.cli</a>.</p>

<pre>
FROM jboss/keycloak:latest

ADD cli/TCPPING.cli /opt/jboss/tools/cli/jgroups/discovery/
ADD cli/JDBC_PING.cli /opt/jboss/tools/cli/jgroups/discovery/
</pre>

<p>First of all we should know that for a Keycloak cluster, all keycloak instances should use same database and this is very simple, another thing is about cache(generally there are two kinds of cache in Keycloaks, the 1st is persistent data cache read from database aim to improve performance like realm/client/user, the 2nd is the non-persistent data cache like sessions/clientSessions, the 2nd is very important for a cluster) which is a little bit complex to configure, we have to make sure the consistent of cache in a cluster view.</p>

<p>Totally here are 3 solutions for clustering, and all of the solutions are base on the discovery protocols of <a href="http://jgroups.org/">JGroups</a> (Keycloak use <a href="http://infinispan.org/">Infinispan</a> cache and Infinispan use JGroups to discover nodes).</p>

<h3>1. PING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#PING">PING</a> is the default enabled clustering solution of Keycloak using UDP protocol, and you don't need to do any configuration for this.</p>
<p>But PING is only available when multicast network is enabled and port 55200 should be exposed, e.g. bare metals, VMs, docker containers in the same host.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/ping-deployment.jpg"/>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers in same host.</p>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/ping-log.png"/>

<h3>2. TCPPING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#TCPPING_Prot">TCPPING</a> use TCP protocol with 7600 port. This can be used when multicast is not available, e.g. deployments cross DC, containers cross host.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/tcp-ping-deployment.jpg"/>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers cross host.</p>
<p>And in this solution we need to set three below environment variables for containers.
<pre>
#IP address of this host, please make sure this IP can be accessed by the other Keycloak instances
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP=172.21.48.39
#protocol
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=TCPPING
#IP and Port of all host
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES=initial_hosts="172.21.48.4[7600],172.21.48.39[7600]"
</pre>
</p>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/tcp-ping-log.png"/>

<h3>3. JDBC_PING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#_jdbc_ping">JDBC_PING</a> use TCP protocol with 7600 port which is similar as TCPPING, but the difference between them is, TCPPING requires you configure the IP and port of all instances,  for JDBC_PING you just need to configure the IP and port of current instance, this is because in JDBC_PING solution each instance insert its own information into database and the instances discover peers by the ping data read from database.</p>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers cross host.</p>
<p>And in this solution we need to set two below environment variables for containers.
<pre>
#IP address of this host, please make sure this IP can be accessed by the other Keycloak instances
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP=172.21.48.39
#protocol
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING
</pre>
</p>
<p>The ping data of all instances haven been saved in database after instances started.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/jdbc-ping-data.png"/>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/jdbc-ping-log.png"/>

<h3>One more thing</h3>
<p>The above solutions are available for most scenarios, but they are still not enough for some others, e.g.Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The typical deployment on Kubernetes is one Deployment/ReplicateSet/StatefulSet contains multi Keycloak Pods, the Pods are really dynamic as they can scale up and down or failover to another node, which requires the cluster to discover and remove these dynamic members.</p>
<p>On Kubernetes we can use <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/blob/master/server/README.md#openshift-example-with-dnsdns_ping">DNS_PING</a> or <a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING</a> which work quite well in  <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/keycloak/templates/statefulset.yaml#L92">practice</a>. </p>
<p>Besides DNS_PING and KUBE_PING, JDBC_PING is another option for Kubernetes. </p>
<p>On Kubernetes multicast is available only for the containers in the same node and a pod has no static ip which can be used to configure TCPPING or JDBC_PING. But in the JDBC_PING.cli mentioned above we have handled this, if you don't set the JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP env, the pod ip will be used, that means on Kubernetes you can simply set JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING then your keycloak cluster is ok.</p>
