                <p class="blog-date">Friday, May 10 2019, posted by 张立强 liqiang@fit2cloud.com</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/html">This post shares some solutions to setup Keycloak cluster in various scenarios (e.g. cross-DC, docker cross-host, Kubernetes).</p>

<p>If you'd like to setup Keycloak cluster, this blog may give you some reference.</p>

<p>Two cli script files are added to the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/jboss/keycloak/">Keycloak image</a> as per the <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/blob/master/server/README.md#adding-custom-discovery-protocols">guide</a>.</p>

<p>The Dockerfile is below and these two files are the most important matter for this blog, you can find them from <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration/master/src/TCPPING.cli">TCPPING.cli</a> and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration/master/src/JDBC_PING.cli">JDBC_PING.cli</a>.</p>

<pre>
FROM jboss/keycloak:latest

ADD cli/TCPPING.cli /opt/jboss/tools/cli/jgroups/discovery/
ADD cli/JDBC_PING.cli /opt/jboss/tools/cli/jgroups/discovery/
</pre>

<p>First of all we should know that for a Keycloak cluster, all keycloak instances should use same database and this is very simple, another thing is about cache(generally there are two kinds of cache in Keycloaks, the 1st is persistent data cache read from database aim to improve performance like realm/client/user, the 2nd is the non-persistent data cache like sessions/clientSessions, the 2nd is very important for a cluster) which is a little bit complex to configure, we have to make sure the consistent of cache in a cluster view.</p>

<p>Totally here are 3 solutions for clustering, and all of the solutions are base on the discovery protocols of <a href="http://jgroups.org/">JGroups</a> (Keycloak use <a href="http://infinispan.org/">Infinispan</a> cache and Infinispan use JGroups to discover nodes).</p>

<h3>1. PING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#PING">PING</a> is the default enabled clustering solution of Keycloak using UDP protocol, and you don't need to do any configuration for this.</p>
<p>But PING is only available when multicast network is enabled and port 55200 should be exposed, e.g. bare metals, VMs, docker containers in the same host.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/ping-deployment.jpg"/>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers in same host.</p>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/ping-log.png"/>

<h3>2. TCPPING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#TCPPING_Prot">TCPPING</a> use TCP protocol with 7600 port. This can be used when multicast is not available, e.g. deployments cross DC, containers cross host.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/tcp-ping-deployment.jpg"/>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers cross host.</p>
<p>And in this solution we need to set three below environment variables for containers.
<pre>
#IP address of this host, please make sure this IP can be accessed by the other Keycloak instances
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP=172.21.48.39
#protocol
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=TCPPING
#IP and Port of all host
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROPERTIES=initial_hosts="172.21.48.4[7600],172.21.48.39[7600]"
</pre>
</p>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/tcp-ping-log.png"/>

<h3>3. JDBC_PING</h3>
<p><a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#_jdbc_ping">JDBC_PING</a> use TCP protocol with 7600 port which is similar as TCPPING, but the difference between them is, TCPPING requires you configure the IP and port of all instances,  for JDBC_PING you just need to configure the IP and port of current instance, this is because in JDBC_PING solution each instance insert its own information into database and the instances discover peers by the ping data read from database.</p>
<p>We tested this by two Keycloak containers cross host.</p>
<p>And in this solution we need to set two below environment variables for containers.
<pre>
#IP address of this host, please make sure this IP can be accessed by the other Keycloak instances
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP=172.21.48.39
#protocol
JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING
</pre>
</p>
<p>The ping data of all instances haven been saved in database after instances started.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/jdbc-ping-data.png"/>
<p>The logs show that the two Keycloak instances discovered each other and clustered.</p>
<img src="https://www.keycloak.org/resources/images/blog/cluster-setup/jdbc-ping-log.png"/>

<h3>One more thing</h3>
<p>The above solutions are available for most scenarios, but they are still not enough for some others, e.g.Kubernetes.</p>
<p>The typical deployment on Kubernetes is one Deployment/ReplicateSet/StatefulSet contains multi Keycloak Pods, the Pods are really dynamic as they can scale up and down or failover to another node, which requires the cluster to discover and remove these dynamic members.</p>
<p>On Kubernetes we can use <a href="https://github.com/jboss-dockerfiles/keycloak/blob/master/server/README.md#openshift-example-with-dnsdns_ping">DNS_PING</a> or <a href="http://jgroups.org/manual/#_kube_ping">KUBE_PING</a> which work quite well in  <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/blob/master/stable/keycloak/templates/statefulset.yaml#L92">practice</a>. </p>
<p>Besides DNS_PING and KUBE_PING, JDBC_PING is another option for Kubernetes. </p>
<p>On Kubernetes multicast is available only for the containers in the same node and a pod has no static ip which can be used to configure TCPPING or JDBC_PING. But in the JDBC_PING.cli mentioned above we have handled this, if you don't set the JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_EXTERNAL_IP env, the pod ip will be used, that means on Kubernetes you can simply set JGROUPS_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL=JDBC_PING then your keycloak cluster is ok.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>Suggestions and comments can be discussed via <a href="https://lists.jboss.org/mailman/listinfo/keycloak-user">Keycloak User Mail List</a> or <a href="https://github.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration">this GitHub Repository</a>.</p>

We have a lot of news to share in this second edition, so fasten your seatbelt and let's go!
</p>


<h2>News from the community</h2>
<p>
First of all, we would like to thank the whole community, which has contributed to this edition by sharing their links, tips, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  An increasing number of API Management/Gateway solutions can now be integrated with Keycloak. Recently, <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/">Ambassador</a>, an Open Source Kubernetes-Native API Gateway built on the Envoy Proxy, has added <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/reference/idp-support/keycloak/">support for Keycloak</a>; it has also published a <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/tutorials/github-sso/">quickstart</a> to show how Keycloak can be used to add Github as Identity provider.   
</p>
<p>
We have some good news for Python users. Akhil Lawrence has created a <a href="https://github.com/akhilputhiry/keycloak-client/releases">Python Keycloak Adapter Client</a>. Be sure to check out the really nice <a href="https://keycloak-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">documentation</a> that comes with many usage examples.  
</p>
<p>
Like any other project, setting up clustering can be somehow complex. Liqiang has shared with us his <a href="https://github.com/fit2anything/keycloak-cluster-setup-and-configuration">setup and configuration tips</a>. Thanks again for sharing your knowledge with the community!
</p>
<P>
The existing <a href="https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/keycloak">Keycloak Helm Chart</a> has now been deprecated and is now replaced by the <a href="https://github.com/codecentric/helm-charts">one</a> managed by CodeCentric.
</p>
<p>
Dmitry Telegin has created a really nice example on how you can dynamically brand your login theme for Keycloak. Check out the repository <a href="https://github.com/dteleguin/keycloak-dynamic-branding">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
Hayri Cicek has written a nice introductory <a href="https://kodnito.com/posts/microprofile-jwt-with-keycloak/">article</a> on how to use Keycloak and MicroProfile. It even shows the usage of the brand new Client Scope "microprofile-jwt," which has been added in Keycloak 6.0.0.
</p>


<h2>News from the project</h2>
<p>
Keycloak 6.0.1 has been <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/keycloak-601-released.html">released</a>. We know that some people were a bit confused by our new versioning schema. We hope that this <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/versioning.html">blog post</a> will clear it up. 
</p>
<p>
We started the proposal process for Keycloak to be accepted into the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF). We hope that this effort will significantly boost our community adoption with our ultimate goal of becoming the de facto solution for OAuth2/OpenID Connect within Open Source and Cloud Native.
You can watch the presentation to the CNCF TOC (Technical Oversight Committee) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBrmcH9VFYE&feature=youtu.be&t=1032">here</a> and the slides are also available <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bijEpuwaaa6jR1D5PAjyW731-j6Xc1TFHJuUh_FwwK8/edit?ts=5ca774e9#slide=id.g5628e016b1_15_112">here</a>.   
<p>
As mentioned in the previous newsletter, we will now discuss larger features openly on Github. It's community-focused and we have currently two open Pull Requests:
<ul>
<li>
 <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/pull/5">Managing multi-factor authentication and Step-up authentication</a>
</li>
<li>
 <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/pull/6">Implementation of OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant</a> 
</li>
</ul>
</p>

                <h1><a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/04/versioning.html">Keycloak Releases and Versioning</a></h1>

                <p class="blog-date">Wednesday, April 24 2019, posted by Stian Thorgersen</p>

                <div class="blog blog-container">

<p>
We are aiming to achieve a continuous delivery model with Keycloak. By that we mean it should be seamless to upgrade
between Keycloak releases and to keep up to date with the latest release.
</p>

<p>
This requires no breaking changes, but rather deprecating old APIs allowing time to migrate to new APIs.
</p>

<p>
Traditional semantic versioning does not fit very well with this model. By following the mantra of continuous delivery
we would forever be stuck on a major version and only update the minor version, and you could argue whether or not it
would be correct to update the major version when an API that has been deprecated for a long period of time is removed.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, we have made some slight changes to our release cadence and versioning schema.
</p>

<p>
For now, we will have a new feature release roughly 4 times each year. Each release will bump the major version number.
That doesn't mean there are breaking changes, but until we perfect our continuous delivery model there may be some, so
always refer to the migration guide prior to upgrading!
</p>

<p>
We have also decided to drop the Final suffix from releases. That is simply because it is not needed as we have not done
any beta or release candidates for a long time. In the spirit of continuous delivery, we will have individual features
marked as preview rather than whole releases.
</p>

<p>
As a final note, with the reduced release cadence we are planning to do more micro releases. This will be focused on
critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, we may accept contributions to less critical bugs given the fix
is well tested and has low risk of regressions.

<p>
This is the very first "Keycloak Community Newsletter." The goal of this newsletter is to share news about the Keycloak project.
</p>


<h2>News from the community</h2>
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, the community has been really active. Each week several blog posts about Keycloak are published. Here is a short selection.
</p>
<p>
Let's start with Philip Riecks who explains in <a href="https://rieckpil.de/howto-microprofile-jwt-authentication-with-keycloak-and-react/">this article</a> how you can use Microprofile JWT Authentication with Keycloak and React.
</p>
<p>
Ramandeep Singh has been <a href="https://medium.com/@ramandeep.singh.1983/enterprise-web-app-authentication-using-keycloak-and-node-js-c10b0e26b80d">blogging</a> about Keycloak and NodeJS.
</p>
<p>
Joshua Alfred Erney explains in this <a href="https://www.jerney.io/secure-apis-kong-keycloak-1/">blog series</a> how to integrate Keycloak and <a href="https://konghq.com/">Kong</a>, a popular API management platform.
</p>
<P>
With Mohamed Aboullaite's blog post, you will learn how to <a href="https://aboullaite.me/secure-kibana-keycloak/">secure your Kibana dashboards using Keycloak</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally in <a href=https://beyondthekube.com/identity-management-for-on-prem-clusters/?utm_sq=g0u3m590zf">this three-part article</a>, the process of installing Keycloak on Kubernetes will become very clear.
</p>


<h2>News from the project</h2>
<p>
Keycloak 5.0.0 has been <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2019/03/keycloak-500-released.html">released</a> and 6.0.0 is around the corner.
</p>
<p>
From now on, new larger Keycloak's features will be openly discussed. For each new feature, a design document will be created and pushed to our Github repository as a simple MarkDown file. This strategy makes it easy for everyone to comment as well as contribute to the designs by opening Github issues and providing pull requests.
We have already three documents open for discussion:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">W3C Web Authentication - Two-Factor</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/application-initiated-actions.md">Application-Initiated Actions</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/observerability.md">Observerability</a></li>
</ul>


<h2>News from the Identity Management World</h2>
<p>
The big announcement, two weeks ago, was that <a href="https://www.yubico.com/webauthn/">WebAuthn<a/> became an official W3C Standard. This event is a milestone in the world of authentication and Identity Management. The goal of WebAuthn, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAuthn">Wikipedia</a> is to: <i> standardize an interface for public-key authentication of users to web-based applications and services.</i>
The Keycloak community is naturally really interested in this new standard. A design document is <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-community/blob/master/design/web-authn-two-factor.md">available</a> and the community has even started to work on a <a href="https://github.com/webauthn4j/keycloak-webauthn-authenticator">prototype</a>.
</p>


<h2>Conferences / Webinars</h2>
<p>
In March, the Javaland conference was held in Germany. The conference had two talks about Keycloak. Sébastien blanc gave a talk about <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSp6t8vo1LsWBVDmFmFVC43qtwSQK3_UrVfFIQcTpaEmGJohHbwsKj9UYUEZdogRMXWMMJJSskWRHyZ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000">Securing your Microservices with Keycloak</a>. A Github repository contains the <a href="https://github.com/sebastienblanc/quarkus-quickstart">demo</a>. Thomas Darimont also gave an <a href="https://www.javaland.eu/formes/pubfiles/11145218/2019-nn-thomas_darimont-sichere_spring-anwendungen_mit_keycloak-praesentation.pdf">introductory talk</a> in German about Keycloak.
<p>
<p>
In April, at Devoxx France, Guillaume Gillon will talk in French about how to combine <a href="https://cfp.devoxx.fr/2019/talk/BIP-1027/L'open-source_a_la_rescousse_de_mes_APIS:_comment_les_securiser_grace_a_Gravitee.io_et_Keycloak">Keycloak and Gravitee.io</a>.

For each newsletter, we will also highlight a few features for which we would especially like contributions. These features include:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-4593">Support for large number of realms</a> - Keycloak is not designed to handle large amount of realms. When over 50 realms exist, you start to experience issues.</li>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-6073">Support different URLs for front and back channel requests in adapters</a> - When adapters are located alongside Keycloak, it's not always recommended to use the public URL of Keycloak; this issue concerns allowing adapters to use one URL for back-channel requests and a different URL for redirects.</li>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-2939">OpenID Connect Front-Channel Logout</a> - Add support for OpenID Connect Front-Channel logout specification to Keycloak.</li>
<li><a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/KEYCLOAK-2537">SCIM 2</a> - Add support for the SCIM 2 specification to Keycloak, which provides a standards-based interface for user management.</li>
</ul>
