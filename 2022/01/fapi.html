    <h1>Keycloak certified as FAPI and Brazil Open Banking provider</h1>
    <p class="blog-date text-muted">January 06 2022 by Marek Posolda</p>

    <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    This post is more than one year old. The contents within the blog is likely to be out of date.
    </div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are glad to announce that Keycloak 15.0.2 was officially certified as <a href="https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI_OPs">FAPI OpenID Provider</a>! <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_fapi-support">FAPI</a> is a shortcut
for <code>Financial-grade API</code> and the FAPI compliance means that Keycloak is now officially able to be used in the highly confidential financial based deployments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, Keycloak is now certified as <code>FAPI 1 Advanced Final (Generic)</code> provider. For this generic profile, Keycloak is compliant with all the matrix combinations. This means that Keycloak clients
are allowed to use <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9126">PAR</a>, <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-jarm.html">JARM</a>, and
client authentication based on <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8705">Mutual-TLS</a> or <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ClientAuthentication">JSON Web Token signed by Private Key</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak is also certified as Brazil Open Banking provider. For this profile, Keycloak is also compliant with all the matrix combinations. We just did not obtain certification for the DCR,
which requires more complicated setup including registration with official Brazil institutions. However some Brazil banks, which are customers of Keycloak based
product <a href="https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-single-sign-on">RH-SSO 7.5</a>, were able to obtain DCR certification. So technically, the certification with DCR for any
institution using Keycloak or RH-SSO is completely fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see the <a href="https://openid.net/certification/#FAPI_OPs">Official OpenID Page</a> with the details about the certification. For more details
about FAPI support, you can check the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_fapi-support">Keycloak documentation</a> with the details to setup your own Keycloak
deployment to be FAPI compliant.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak 15.0.2 is also compliant with <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-financial-api-ciba-ID1.html">FAPI CIBA</a> and we are working to officially obtain the certification for this.
Moreover, We plan to re-certify Keycloak 15.0.2 with <a href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html">OpenID Connect Core</a>, which Keycloak certified back in 2016.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The FAPI certification was possible just due the awesome work of the <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi/blob/main/README.md">FAPI Working Group</a>.
<a href="https://github.com/keycloak/kc-sig-fapi/blob/main/members.adoc">Members of this group</a> contributed many features related to FAPI, like Client Policies, CIBA, PAR, JARM and others.
I hope that year 2022 will be at least as successful as 2021 and there will be even more contributions related to the FAPI as there are more standards being made and more
certifications to be obtained. If you are interested in contributing to the Keycloak FAPI support, you are welcome to join FAPI Working Group. It is community working group and
it is opened for anyone to join.</p>
