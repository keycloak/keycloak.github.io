    <h1>Keycloak 25.0.0 released</h1>
    <p class="blog-date text-muted">June 10 2024</p>


<p>To download the release go to <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/downloads.html">Keycloak downloads</a>.</p>

    <h2>Highlights</h2>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_account_console_v2_theme_removed">Account Console v2 theme removed</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Account Console v2 theme has been removed from Keycloak. This theme was deprecated in Keycloak 24 and replaced by the Account Console v3 theme. If you are still using this theme, you should migrate to the Account Console v3 theme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_java_21_support">Java 21 support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak now supports OpenJDK 21, as we want to stick to the latest LTS OpenJDK versions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_java_17_support_is_deprecated">Java 17 support is deprecated</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>OpenJDK 17 support is deprecated in Keycloak, and will be removed in a following release in favor of OpenJDK 21.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_most_of_java_adapters_removed">Most of Java adapters removed</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated in the release notes of previous Keycloak version, the most of Java adapters are now removed from the Keycloak codebase and downloads pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For OAuth 2.0/OIDC, this includes removal of the Tomcat adapter, WildFly/EAP adapter, Servlet Filter adapter, <code>KeycloakInstalled</code> desktop adapter, the <code>jaxrs-oauth-client</code> adapter, JAAS login modules, Spring adapter and SpringBoot adapters.
You can check <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/2023/03/adapter-deprecation-update.html">our older post</a> for the list of some alternatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For SAML, this includes removal of the Tomcat adapter and Servlet filter adapter. SAML adapters are still supported with WildFly and JBoss EAP.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The generic Authorization Client library is still supported, and we still plan to support it. It aims to be used in combination with any other OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect libraries. You can
check the <a href="https://github.com/keycloak/keycloak-quickstarts">quickstarts</a> for some examples where this authorization client library is used together with the 3rd party Java adapters like
Elytron OIDC or SpringBoot. You can check the quickstarts also for the example of SAML adapter used with WildFly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_upgrade_to_patternfly_5">Upgrade to PatternFly 5</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Keycloak 24, the Welcome page is updated to use <a href="https://www.patternfly.org/">PatternFly 5</a>, the latest version of the design system that underpins the user interface of Keycloak. In this release, the  Admin Console and Account Console are also updated to use PatternFly 5. If you want to extend and customize the Admin Console and Account Console, review <a href="https://www.patternfly.org/get-started/upgrade/">the changes in PatternFly 5</a> and update your customizations accordingly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_argon2_password_hashing">Argon2 password hashing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Argon2 is now the default password hashing algorithm used by Keycloak in a non-FIPS environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Argon2 was the winner of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_Hashing_Competition">2015 password hashing competition</a>
and is the recommended hashing algorithm by <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#argon2id">OWASP</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Keycloak 24 the default hashing iterations for PBKDF2 were increased from 27.5K to 210K, resulting in a more than
10 times increase in the amount of CPU time required to generate a password hash. With Argon2 it is possible to achieve
better security, with almost the same CPU time as previous releases of Keycloak. One downside is Argon2 requires more
memory, which is a requirement to be resistant against GPU attacks. The defaults for Argon2 in Keycloak requires 7MB
per-hashing request.
To prevent excessive memory and CPU usage, the parallel computation of hashes by Argon2 is by default limited to the number of cores available to the JVM.
To support the memory intensive nature of Argon2, we have updated the default GC from ParallelGC to G1GC for a better heap utilization.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_new_hostname_options">New Hostname options</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In response to the complexity and lack of intuitiveness experienced with previous hostname configuration settings, we are proud to introduce Hostname v2 options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have listened to your feedback, tackled the tricky issues, and created a smoother experience for managing hostname configuration.
Be aware that even the behavior behind these options has changed and requires your attention - if you are dealing with custom hostname settings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hostname v2 options are supported by default, as the old hostname options are deprecated and will be removed in the following releases.
You should migrate to them as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New options are activated by default, so Keycloak will not recognize the old ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For information on how to migrate, see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/25.0.0/upgrading/">Upgrading Guide</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_persistent_user_sessions">Persistent user sessions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previous versions of Keycloak stored only offline user and offline client sessions in the databases.
The new feature <code>persistent-user-session</code> stores online user sessions and online client sessions not only in memory, but also in the database.
This will allow a user to stay logged in even if all instances of Keycloak are restarted or upgraded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The feature is a preview feature and disabled by default. To use it, add the following to your build command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>bin/kc.sh build --features=persistent-user-session ...</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For more details see the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/server/features">Enabling and disabling features</a> guide.
The <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/high-availability/concepts-memory-and-cpu-sizing">sizing guide</a> contains a new paragraph describing the updated resource requirements when this feature is enabled.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_cookies_updates">Cookies updates</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_samesite_attribute_set_for_all_cookies">SameSite attribute set for all cookies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following cookies did not use to set the <code>SameSite</code> attribute, which in recent browser versions results in them
defaulting to <code>SameSite=Lax</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>KC_STATE_CHECKER</code> now sets <code>SameSite=Strict</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>KC_RESTART</code> now sets <code>SameSite=None</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>KEYCLOAK_LOCALE</code> now sets <code>SameSite=None</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>KEYCLOAK_REMEMBER_ME</code> now sets <code>SameSite=None</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default value <code>SameSite=Lax</code> causes issues with POST based bindings, mostly applicable to SAML, but also used in
some OpenID Connect / OAuth 2.0 flows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_removing_kc_auth_state_cookie">Removing KC_AUTH_STATE cookie</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cookie <code>KC_AUTH_STATE</code> is removed and it is no longer set by the Keycloak server as this server no longer needs this cookie.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_deprecated_cookie_methods_removed">Deprecated cookie methods removed</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following APIs for setting custom cookies have been removed:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ServerCookie</code> - replaced by <code>NewCookie.Builder</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>LocaleSelectorProvider.KEYCLOAK_LOCALE</code> - replaced by <code>CookieType.LOCALE</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>HttpCookie</code> - replaced by <code>NewCookie.Builder</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>HttpResponse.setCookieIfAbsent(HttpCookie cookie)</code> - replaced by <code>HttpResponse.setCookieIfAbsent(NewCookie cookie)</code></p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_addressed_you_are_already_logged_in_for_expired_authentication_sessions">Addressed 'You are already logged in' for expired authentication sessions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Keycloak 23 release provided improvements for when a user is authenticated in parallel in multiple browser tabs. However, this improvement did not address the case when an authentication session
expired. Now for the case when user is already logged-in in one browser tab and an authentication session expired in other browser tabs, Keycloak is able to redirect back to the client
application with an OIDC/SAML error, so the client application can immediately retry authentication, which should usually automatically log in the application because of the SSO session. For more
details, see <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/25.0.0/server_admin/#_authentication-sessions">Server Administration Guide authentication sessions</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_lightweight_access_token_to_be_even_more_lightweight">Lightweight access token to be even more lightweight</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In previous releases, the support for lightweight access token was added. In this release, we managed to remove even more built-in claims from the lightweight access token. The claims are added
by protocol mappers. Some of them affect even the regular access tokens or ID tokens as they were not strictly required by the OIDC specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Claims <code>sub</code> and <code>auth_time</code> are added by protocol mappers now, which are configured by default on the new client scope <code>basic</code>, which is added automatically to all the clients. The claims are still added to the ID token and access token as before, but not to lightweight access token.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim <code>nonce</code> is added only to the ID token now.  It is not added to a regular access token or lightweight access token. For backwards compatibility, you can add this claim to an access token by protocol mapper, which needs to be explicitly configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Claim <code>session_state</code> is not added to any token now. It is still possible to add it by protocol mapper if needed. There is still the other dedicated claim <code>sid</code> supported by the specification, which was available in previous versions as well and which has exactly the same value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_support_for_applicationjwt_media_type_in_token_introspection_endpoint">Support for application/jwt media-type in token introspection endpoint</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use the HTTP Header <code>Accept: application/jwt</code> when invoking a token introspection endpoint. When enabled for a particular client, it returns a claim <code>jwt</code> from the
token introspection endpoint with the full JWT access token, which can be useful especially for the use-cases when the client calling introspection endpoint used lightweight access
token. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thomasdarimont">Thomas Darimont</a> for the contribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_password_policy_for_check_if_password_contains_username">Password policy for check if password contains Username</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak supports a new password policy that allows you to deny user passwords which contains the user username.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_required_actions_improvements">Required actions improvements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the Admin Console, you can now configure some required actions in the <strong>Required actions</strong> tab of a particular realm. Currently, the <strong>Update password</strong> is the only built-in configurable required action. It supports setting <strong>Maximum Age of Authentication</strong>, which is the maximum time users can update their password
by the <code>kc_action</code> parameter (used for instance when updating password in the Account Console) without re-authentication. The sorting of required actions is also improved. When there are multiple required
actions during authentication, all actions are sorted together regardless of whether those are actions set during authentication (for instance by the <code>kc_action</code> parameter) or actions added to the user account manually by an administrator.
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/thomasdarimont">Thomas Darimont</a> and <a href="https://github.com/danielFesenmeyer">Daniel Fesenmeyer</a> for the contributions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_passkeys_improvements">Passkeys improvements</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The support for Passkeys conditional UI was added. When the Passkeys preview feature is enabled, there is a dedicated authenticator available, which means you can select from a list of available passkeys accounts
and authenticate a user based on that. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/tnorimat">Takashi Norimatsu</a> for the contribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_default_client_profile_for_saml">Default client profile for SAML</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default client profile to have secured SAML clients was added. When browsing through client policies of a realm in the Admin Console, you see a new client profile <code>saml-security-profile</code>. When it is used, there are
security best practices applied for SAML clients such as signatures are enforced, SAML Redirect binding is disabled, and wildcard redirect URLs are prohibited.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_authenticator_for_override_existing_idp_link_during_first_broker_login">Authenticator for override existing IDP link during first-broker-login</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There was new authenticator <code>Confirm override existing link</code> added. This authenticator allows to override linked IDP username for the Keycloak user, which was already linked to different
IDP identity before. More details in the <a href="https://www.keycloak.org/docs/25.0.0/server_admin/#_override_existing_broker_link">Server Administration Guide</a>. Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/lexcao">Lex Cao</a> for the contribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_openid_for_verifiable_credential_issuance_experimental_support">OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance - experimental support</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is work in progress on the support of OpenID for Verifiable Credential Issuance (OID4VCI). Right now, this is still work in progress, but things are being gradually added. Keycloak
can act as an OID4VC Issuer with support of Pre-Authorized code flow. There is support for verifiable credentials in the JWT-VC, SD-JWT-VC and VCDM formats. Thanks to the members of the OAuth SIG
groups for the contributions and feedback and especially thanks to <a href="https://github.com/wistefan">Stefan Wiedemann</a>, <a href="https://github.com/francis-pouatcha">Francis Pouatcha</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tnorimat">Takashi Norimatsu</a>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_searching_by_user_attribute_no_longer_case_insensitive">Searching by user attribute no longer case insensitive</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When searching for users by user attribute, Keycloak no longer searches for user attribute names forcing lower case comparisons. The goal of this change was to speed up searches by using Keycloak&#8217;s native index on the user attribute table. If your database collation is case-insensitive, your search results will stay the same. If your database collation is case-sensitive, you might see less search results than before.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_breaking_fix_in_authorization_client_library">Breaking fix in authorization client library</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For users of the <code>keycloak-authz-client</code> library, calling <code>AuthorizationResource.getPermissions(&#8230;&#8203;)</code> now correctly returns a <code>List&lt;Permission&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previously, it would return a <code>List&lt;Map&gt;</code> at runtime, even though the method declaration advertised <code>List&lt;Permission&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This fix will break code that relied on casting the List or its contents to <code>List&lt;Map&gt;</code>. If you have used this method in any capacity, you are likely to have done this and be affected.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_ids_are_no_longer_set_when_exporting_authorization_settings_for_a_client">IDs are no longer set when exporting authorization settings for a client</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When exporting the authorization settings for a client, the IDs for resources, scopes, and policies are no longer set. As a
result, you can now import the settings from a client to another client.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_management_port_for_metrics_and_health_endpoints">Management port for metrics and health endpoints</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Metrics and health checks endpoints are no longer accessible through the standard Keycloak server port.
As these endpoints should be hidden from the outside world, they can be accessed on a separate default management port <code>9000</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It allows to not expose it to the users as standard Keycloak endpoints in Kubernetes environments.
The new management interface provides a new set of options and is fully configurable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak Operator assumes the management interface is turned on by default.

<h3 id="_syslog_for_remote_logging">Syslog for remote logging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak now supports <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog">Syslog</a> protocol for remote logging.
It utilizes the protocol defined in <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5424">RFC 5424</a>.
By default, the syslog handler is disabled, but when enabled, it sends all log events to a remote syslog server.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of functionality, the feature is completed. However, we still have work to do to make it fully supported in the next major release.
This remaining work is mainly about preparing the feature for production deployments with a focus on scalability. Also, depending
on the feedback we get until the next major release, we might eventually accept additional capabilities and add more value to
the feature, without compromising its roadmap.</p>
