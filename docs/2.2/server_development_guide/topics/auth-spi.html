<h2 id="_auth_spi">Authentication SPI</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak comes out of the box with a bunch of different authentication mechanisms: kerberos, password, and otp.
These mechanisms may not meet all of your requirements and you may want to plug in your own custom ones.
Keycloak provides an authentication SPI that you can use to write new plugins.
The admin console supports applying, ordering, and configuring these new mechanisms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak also supports a simple registration form.
Different aspects of this form can be enabled and disabled i.e.
Recaptcha support can be turned off and on.
The same authentication SPI can be used to add another page to the registration flow or reimplement it entirely.
There&#x2019;s also an additional fine-grain SPI you can use to add specific validations and user extensions to the built in registration form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A required action in Keycloak is an action that a user has to perform after he authenticates.
After the action is performed successfully, the user doesn&#x2019;t have to perform the action again.
Keycloak comes with some built in required actions like &quot;reset password&quot;.  This action forces the user to change their password after they have logged in.
You can write and plug in your own required actions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_terms">Terms</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To first learn about the Authentication SPI, let&#x2019;s go over some of the terms used to describe it.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Authentication Flow</dt>
<dd>
<p>A flow is a container for all authentications that must happen during login or registration.
If you go to the admin console authentication page, you can view all the defined flows in the system and what authenticators they are made up of.
Flows can contain other flows.
You can also bind a new different flow for browser login, direct grant access, and registration.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Authenticator</dt>
<dd>
<p>An authenticator is a pluggable component that hold the logic for performing the authentication or action within a flow.
It is usually a singleton.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Execution</dt>
<dd>
<p>An execution is an object that binds the authenticator to the flow and the authenticator to the configuration of the authenticator.
Flows contain execution entries.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Execution Requirement</dt>
<dd>
<p>Each execution defines how an authenticator behaves in a flow.
The requirement defines whether the authenticator is enabled, disabled, optional, required, or an alternative.
An alternative requirement means that the authentiactor is optional unless no other alternative authenticator is successful in the flow.
For example, cookie authentication, kerberos, and the set of all login forms are all alternative.
If one of those is successful, none of the others are executed.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Authenticator Config</dt>
<dd>
<p>This object defines the configuration for the Authenticator for a specific execution within an authentication flow.
Each execution can have a different config.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Required Action</dt>
<dd>
<p>After authentication completes, the user might have one or more one-time actions he must complete before he is allowed to login.
The user might be required to set up an OTP token generator or reset an expired password or even accept a Terms and Conditions document.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_algorithm_overview">Algorithm Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#x2019;s talk about how this all works for browser login.
Let&#x2019;s assume the following flows, executions and sub flows.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>Cookie - ALTERNATIVE
Kerberos - ALTERNATIVE
Forms Subflow - ALTERNATIVE
           Username/Password Form - REQUIRED
           OTP Password Form - OPTIONAL</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the top level of the form we have 3 executions of which all are alternatively required.
This means that if any of these are successful, then the others do not have to execute.
The Username/Password form is not executed if there is an SSO Cookie set or a successful Kerberos login.
Let&#x2019;s walk through the steps from when a client first redirects to keycloak to authenticate the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The OpenID Connect or SAML protocol provider unpacks relevent data, verifies the client and any signatures.
It creates a ClientSessionModel.
It looks up what the browser flow should be, then starts executing the flow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The flow looks at the cookie execution and sees that it is an alternative.
It loads the cookie provider.
It checks to see if the cookie provider requires that a user already be associated with the client session.
Cookie provider does not require a user.
If it did, the flow would abort and the user would see an error screen.
Cookie provider then executes.
Its purpose is to see if there is an SSO cookie set.
If there is one set, it is validated and the UserSessionModel is verified and associated with the ClientSessionModel.
The Cookie provider returns a success() status if the SSO cookie exists and is validated.
Since the cookie provider returned success and each execution at this level of the flow is ALTERNATIVE, no other execution is executed and this results in a successful login.
If there is no SSO cookie, the cookie provider returns with a status of attempted().  This means there was no error condition, but no success either.
The provider tried, but the request just wasn&#x2019;t set up to handle this authenticator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next the flow looks at the Kerberos execution.
This is also an alternative.
The kerberos provider also does not require a user to be already set up and associated with the ClientSessionModel so this provider is executed.
Kerberos uses the SPNEGO browser protocol.
This requires a series of challenge/responses between the server and client exchanging negotiation headers.
The kerberos provider does not see any negotiate header, so it assumes that this is the first interaction between the server and client.
It therefore creates an HTTP challenge response to the client and sets a forceChallenge() status.
A forceChallenge() means that this HTTP response cannot be ignored by the flow and must be returned to the client.
If instead the provider returned a challenge() status, the flow would hold the challenge response until all other alternatives are attempted.
So, in this initial phase, the flow would stop and the challenge response would be sent back to the browser.
If the browser then responds with a successful negotiate header, the provider associates the user with the ClientSession and the flow ends because the rest of the executions on this level of the flow are all alternatives.
Otherwise, again, the kerberos provider sets an attempted() status and the flow continues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next execution is a subflow called Forms.
The executions for this subflow are loaded and the same processing logic occurs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first execution in the Forms subflow is the UsernamePassword provider.
This provider also does not require for a user to already be associated with the flow.
This provider creates challenge HTTP response and sets its status to challenge(). This execution is required, so the flow honors this challenge and sends the HTTP response back to the browser.
This response is a rendering of the Username/Password HTML page.
The user enters in their username and password and clicks submit.
This HTTP request is directed to the UsernamePassword provider.
If the user entered an invalid username or password, a new challenge response is created and a status of failureChallenge() is set for this execution.
A failureChallenge() means that there is a challenge, but that the flow should log this as an error in the error log.
This error log can be used to lock accounts or IP Addresses that have had too many login failures.
If the username and password is valid, the provider associated the UserModel with the ClientSessionModel and returns a status of success()</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next execution is the OTP Form.
This provider requires that a user has been associated with the flow.
This requirement is satisfied because the UsernamePassword provider already associated the user with the flow.
Since a user is required for this provider, the provider is also asked if the user is configured to use this provider.
If user is not configured, and this execution is required, then the flow will then set up a required action that the user must perform after authentication is complete.
For OTP, this means the OTP setup page.
If the execution was optional, then this execution is skipped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the flow is complete, the authentication processor creates a UserSessionModel and associates it with the ClientSessionModel.
It then checks to see if the user is required to complete any required actions before logging in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First, each required action&#x2019;s evaluateTriggers() method is called.
This allows the required action provider to figure out if there is some state that might trigger the action to be fired.
For example, if your realm has a password expiration policy, it might be triggered by this method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each required action associated with the user that has its requiredActionChallenge() method called.
Here the provider sets up an HTTP response which renders the page for the required action.
This is done by setting a challenge status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the required action is ultimately successful, then the required action is removed from the user&#x2019;s require actions list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After all required actions have been resolved, the user is finally logged in.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="_auth_spi_walkthrough">Authenticator SPI Walk Through</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we&#x2019;ll take a look at the Authenticator interface.
For this, we are going to implement an authenticator that requires that a user enter in the answer to a secret question like &quot;What is your mother&#x2019;s maiden name?&quot;.  This example is fully implemented and contained in the examples/providers/authenticator directory of the demo distribution of Keycloak.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The classes you must implement are the org.keycloak.authentication.AuthenticatorFactory and Authenticator interfaces.
The Authenticator interface defines the logic.
The AuthenticatorFactory is responsible for creating instances of an Authenticator.
They both extend a more generic Provider and ProviderFactory set of interfaces that other Keycloak components like User Federation do.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_packaging_classes_and_deployment">Packaging Classes and Deployment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will package your classes within a single jar.
This jar must contain a file named  <code>org.keycloak.authentication.AuthenticatorFactory</code>                and must be contained in the <code>META-INF/services/</code> directory of your jar.
This file must list the fully qualified classname of each AuthenticatorFactory implementation you have in the jar.

<h4 id="_implementing_an_authenticator">Implementing an Authenticator</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When implementing the Authenticator interface, the first method that needs to be implemented is the requiresUser() method.
For our example, this method must return true as we need to validate the secret question associated with the user.
A provider like kerberos would return false from this method as it can resolve a user from the negotiate header.
This example, however, is validating a specific credential of a specific user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next method to implement is the configuredFor() method.
This method is responsible for determining if the user is configured for this particular authenticator.
For this example, we need to check if the answer to the secret question has been set up by the user or not.
In our case we are storing this information, hashed, within a UserCredentialValueModel within the UserModel (just like passwords are stored).  Here&#x2019;s how we do this very simple check:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="hljs-annotation">@Override</span>
  <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">boolean</span> <span class="hljs-title">configuredFor</span><span class="hljs-params">(KeycloakSession session, RealmModel realm, UserModel user)</span> </span>{
     <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> session.users().configuredForCredentialType(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;secret_question&quot;</span>, realm, user);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuredForCredentialType() call queries the user to see if it supports that credential type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next method to implement on the Authenticator is setRequiredActions().  If configuredFor() returns false and our example authenticator is required within the flow, this method will be called.
It is responsible for registering any required actions that must be performed by the user.
In our example, we need to register a required action that will force the user to set up the answer to the secret question.
We will implement this required action provider later in this chapter.
Here is the implementation of the setRequiredActions() method.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="hljs-annotation">@Override</span>

        user.addRequiredAction(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;SECRET_QUESTION_CONFIG&quot;</span>);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we are getting into the meat of the Authenticator implementation.
The next method to implement is authenticate().  This is the initial method the flow invokes when the execution is first visited.
What we want is that if a user has answered the secret question already on their browser&#x2019;s machine, then the user doesn&#x2019;t have to answer the question again, making that machine &quot;trusted&quot;.  The authenticate() method isn&#x2019;t responsible for processing the secret question form.
Its sole purpose is to render the page or to continue the flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">    <span class="hljs-annotation">@Override</span>

        }
        Response challenge = loginForm(context).createForm(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;secret_question.ftl&quot;</span>);
        context.challenge(challenge);
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hasCookie() method checks to see if there is already a cookie set on the browser which indicates that the secret question has already been answered.
If that returns true, we just mark this execution&#x2019;s status as SUCCESS using the AuthenticationFlowContext.success() method and returning from the authentication() method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the hasCookie() method returns false, we must return a response that renders the secret question HTML form.
AuthenticationFlowContext has a form() method that initializes a Freemarker page builder with appropriate base information needed to build the form.
This page builder is called <code>org.keycloak.login.LoginFormsProvider</code>.
the LoginFormsProvider.createForm() method loads a Freemarker template file from your login theme.
Additionally you can call the LoginFormsProvider.setAttribute() method if you want to pass additional information to the Freemarker template.
We&#x2019;ll go over this later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calling LoginFormsProvider.createForm() returns a JAX-RS Response object.
We then call AuthenticationFlowContext.challenge() passing in this response.
This sets the status of the execution as CHALLENGE and if the execution is Required, this JAX-RS Response object will be sent to the browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, the HTML page asking for the answer to a secret question is displayed to the user and the user enteres in the answer and clicks submit.
The action URL of the HTML form will send an HTTP request to the flow.
The flow will end up invoking the action() method of our Authenticator implementation.</p>

<p>If the answer is not valid, we rebuild the HTML Form with an additional error message.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is entirely possible for you to implement your own flow with a set of Authenticators to totally change how regisration is done in Keycloak.
But what you&#x2019;ll usually want to do is just add a little bit of validation to the out of the box registration page.
An additional SPI was created to be able to do this.
It basically allows you to add validation of form elements on the page as well as to initialize UserModel attributes and data after the user has been registered.
We&#x2019;ll look at both the implementation of the user profile registration processing as well as the registration Google Recaptcha plugin.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_implementation_formaction_interface">Implementation FormAction Interface</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The core interface you have to implement is the FormAction interface.
A FormAction is responsible for rendering and processing a portion of the page.
Rendering is done in the buildPage() method, validation is done in the validate() method, post validation operations are done in success().  Let&#x2019;s first take a look at buildPage() method of the Recaptcha plugin.</p>

<p>The Recaptcha buildPage() method is a callback by the form flow to help render the page.
It receives a form parameter which is a LoginFormsProvider.
You can add additional attributes to the form provider so that they can be displayed in the HTML page generated by the registration Freemarker template.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code above is from the registration recaptcha plugin.
Recaptcha requires some specific settings that must be obtained from configuration.
FormActions are configured in the exact same was as Authenticators are.
In this example, we pull the Google Recaptcha site key from configuration and add it as an attribute to the form provider.
Our regstration template file can read this attribute now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recaptcha also has the requirement of loading a javascript script.
You can do this by calling LoginFormsProvider.addScript() passing in the URL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For user profile processing, there is no additional information that it needs to add to the form, so its buildPage() method is empty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next meaty part of this interface is the validate() method.
This is called immediately upon receiving a form post.

<p>Here we obtain the form data that the Recaptcha widget adds to the form.
We obtain the Recaptcha secret key from configuration.
We then validate the recaptcha.
If successful, ValidationContext.success() is called.
If not, we invoke ValidationContext.validationError() passing in the formData (so the user doesn&#x2019;t have to re-enter data), we also specify an error message we want displayed.
The error message must point to a message bundle property in the internationalized message bundles.

an alternative email attribute.</p>

<p>As you can see, this validate() method of user profile processing makes sure that the email, first, and last name are filled in in the form.
It also makes sure that email is in the right format.
If any of these validations fail, an error message is queued up for rendering.
Any fields in error are removed from the form data.
Error messages are represented by the FormMessage class.
The first parameter of the constructor of this class takes the HTML element id.
The input in error will be highlighted when the form is re-rendered.
The second parameter is a message reference id.
This id must correspond to a property in one of the localized message bundle files.

This file must list the fully qualified classname of each FormActionFactory implementation you have in the jar.

<h4 id="_adding_formaction_to_the_registration_flow">Adding FormAction to the Registration Flow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding an FormAction to a registration page flow must be done in the admin console.
If you go to the Authentication menu item and go to the Flow tab, you will be able to view the currently defined flows.
You cannot modify an built in flows, so, to add the Authenticator we&#x2019;ve created you have to copy an existing flow or create your own.
I&#x2019;m hoping the UI is intuitive enough so that you can figure out for yourself how to create a flow and add the FormAction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically you&#x2019;ll have to copy the registration flow.
Then click Actions menu to the right of the Registration Form, and pick &quot;Add Execution&quot; to add a new execution.
You&#x2019;ll pick the FormAction from the selection list.
Make sure your FormAction comes after &quot;Registration User Creation&quot; by using the down errors to move it if your FormAction isn&#x2019;t already listed after &quot;Registration User Creation&quot;.  You want your FormAction to come after user creation because the success() method of Regsitration User Creation is responsible for creating the new UserModel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you&#x2019;ve created your flow, you have to bind it to registration.
If you go to the Authentication menu and go  to the Bindings tab you will see options to bind a flow to the browser, registration, or direct grant flow.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_modifying_forgot_password_credential_flow">Modifying Forgot Password/Credential Flow</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak also has a specific authentication flow for forgot password, or rather credential reset initiated by a user.
If you go to the admin console flows page, there is a &quot;reset credentials&quot; flow.
By default, Keycloak asks for the email or username of the user and sends an email to them.
If the user clicks on the link, then they are able to reset both their password and OTP (if an OTP has been set up).  You can disable automatic OTP reset by disabling the &quot;Reset OTP&quot; authenticator in the flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can add additional functionality to this flow as well.
For example, many deployments would like for the user to answer one or more secret questions in additional to sending an email with a link.
You could expand on the secret question example that comes with the distro and incorporate it into the reset credential flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing to note if you are extending the reset credentials flow.
The first &quot;authenticator&quot; is just a page to obtain the username or email.
If the username or email exists, then the AuthenticationFlowContext.getUser() will return the located user.
Otherwise this will be null.
This form <strong>WILL NOT</strong> re-ask the user to enter in an email or username if the previous email or username did not exist.
You need to prevent attackers from being able to guess valid users.
So, if AuthenticationFlowContext.getUser() returns null, you should proceed with the flow to make it look like a valid user was selected.
I suggest that if you want to add secret questions to this flow, you should ask these questions after the email is sent.
In other words, add your custom authenticator after the &quot;Send Reset Email&quot; authenticator.</p>

<h3 id="_client_authentication">Authentication of clients</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Keycloak actually supports pluggable authentication for <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a> client applications.
Authentication of client (application) is used under the hood by the Keycloak adapter during sending any backchannel requests
to the Keycloak server (like the request for exchange code to access token after successful authentication or request to refresh token).
But the client authentication can be also used directly by you during <code>Direct Access grants</code> (represented by OAuth2 <code>Resource Owner Password Credentials Flow</code>)
or during <code>Service account</code> authentication (represented by OAuth2 <code>Client Credentials Flow</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="https://keycloak.gitbooks.io/securing-client-applications-guide/content/" target="_blank">Securing Applications and Services Guide</a> for more details about Keycloak adapter and OAuth2 flows.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_default_implementations">Default implementations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Actually Keycloak has 2 builtin implementations of client authentication:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Traditional authentication with client_id and client_secret</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is default mechanism mentioned in the <a href="http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html" target="_blank">OpenID Connect</a>                                or <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749" target="_blank">OAuth2</a> specification and Keycloak supports it since it&#x2019;s early days.
The public client needs to include <code>client_id</code> parameter with it&#x2019;s ID in the POST request (so it&#x2019;s defacto not authenticated) and the confidential client needs to include <code>Authorization: Basic</code> header with the clientId and clientSecret used as username and password.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">Authentication with signed JWT</dt>
<dd>
<p>This is based on the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7523" target="_blank">JWT Bearer Token Profiles for OAuth 2.0</a> specification.
The client/adapter generates the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519" target="_blank">JWT</a> and signs it with his private key.
The Keycloak then verifies the signed JWT with the client&#x2019;s public key and authenticates client based on it.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See the demo example and especially the <code>examples/preconfigured-demo/service-account</code>                for the example application showing service accounts authentication with both clientId+clientSecret and with signed JWT.</p>
